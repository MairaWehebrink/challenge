# Challenge

Hello, Developer!

This is the challenge for developers who are participating in our selection process!
We don't believe in perfect solutions, we just need to understand how you approach software problems.

## Description

You will have to build a system that, through APIs, will be possible:

- [ ] Issue a Credit Card;
- [ ] Process a credit card transaction from a [POS machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zM2OsABOWQ);
- [ ] Pay the Credit Card bill and refund the card limit;
- [ ] Notify that a transaction has been made to other systems that need to be aware of it;

### Scope requirements

- [ ] Requesting approval for a credit card transaction should take no longer than 1 second;
- [ ] Even if the user's account is offline, credit card transactions should still work;
- [ ] Save transaction history;

## Evaluation points

- [ ] System architecture and scalability;
- [ ] Design patterns;
- [ ] Tests and CI configuration;
- [ ] Technologies used;
- [ ] APIs documentation;
- [ ] Commit history;

## Do not spend your time with

- Front-end implementation;
- Writing scripts to deliver the solution to a cloud provider;

## Requirements to delivery the solution

- [ ] It must be possible to run the application via a [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose);
- [ ] Make a private fork from this repository;
- [ ] Open a PR from a branch named with your GitHub username and check both "GabrielBG99" and "guiferpa" to review;
