# Challenge

## Description
You have to build a architecture where through APIs it could be possible: 

- [ ] Issue a credit card 
- [ ] Pay a credit card bill and then include the paid value as credit back
- [ ] Query credit card statements
- [ ] Process a credit card transaction from a [POS machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zM2OsABOWQ)

### :warning: Scope requirements

- [ ] The app that'll process the credit card transaction should have request response time less than 1 second
- [ ] Even if credit card account is offline the app that process credit card transaction doesn't must be offline too

## Evaluation points

- [ ] Design patterns for source code
- [ ] Automated tests
- [ ] Design architecture
- [ ] Real database usage
- [ ] Automated generate docs of API

## Don't spend your time with:

- Front-end implementation
- Creating scripts to delivery the solution in whatever cloud provider
- With 100% tests coverage, test only necessary. (Of course, if you think that 100% is necessary, feel free to do it)

## Requirements to delivery the solution
- [ ] All environment of solution must be provide by [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)
- [ ] Make a fork from this project and then open a PR from a branch named with your GitHub username
